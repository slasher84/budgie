# Budgie

## Now a DCS World Mod

Originally Budgie used DLL injection to function, it is now a mod, effectively a drag and drop install. When an official patch is released, simply delete the Budgie folder and it's gone.

Documentation is being updated, check the release notes on the latest version for more information.
