# Budgie

## Now a DCS World Mod

Originally Budgie used DLL injection to function, it is now a mod, effectively a drag and drop install. When an official patch is released, simply delete the Budgie folder and it's gone.

Documentation is being updated, check the release notes on the latest version for more information.

## Performance

The closer your system is to the Minimum DCS spec, the longer initial stutters and performance issues will last, Budgie takes note of everything calling the offending time function so it's quicker at passing the correct time back to everything except the Mudhen, unfortunately this isn't optimised for lower spec CPUs at this time and I'm investigating improvements in case and official fix is further delayed.

## A note about DLL Injection (6 July)

Both versions of Budgie have been out now for more than 2 weeks and in use by many people, and even with all those eyes on, I don't have a proofreader and only just noticed even the release notes for the mod made reference to injection of TimeFix.dll. This was in error and I will ask for help proofreading in the future and I apologise for any confusion caused. Budgie Mod has never used DLL injection, DCS itself loads the DLL responsible for fixing the problem.
